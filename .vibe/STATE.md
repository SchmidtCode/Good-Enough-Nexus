# STATE

- Schema version: 1.0
- Vibe package version: 0.1.0+codex.20260812081901
- Prompt catalog version: 1.1.0

## Current focus

- Stage: 38
- Checkpoint: 38.7
- Status: NOT_STARTED
- Branch: `infra/viberun-quality-gate`
- Candidate head: `1ab10b525b0990b1b0024b786b1a7e68ed87d717`
- Worktree: `.infra-viberun-quality-gate-worktree`
- Base: `origin/refactor/nexus-1.20-test17` at `36f187824b8a24f6fb51562e6ec1101c300308ef`

## Objective (current checkpoint)

Publish the validated infrastructure branch as one draft PR targeting PR #10, link issue #12, and inspect exact-head CI without merging.

## Deliverables (current checkpoint)

- Final exact-head local validation and non-force remote branch publication.
- Draft PR plus issue #12 coordination comment with factual validation and limitations.
- Exact-head CI, review-thread, mergeability, and local/CI parity inspection.

## Acceptance (current checkpoint)

- [ ] Final local and remote branch heads equal the validated commit.
- [ ] The new PR remains draft against `refactor/nexus-1.20-test17` and issue #12 remains open with a linking comment.
- [ ] Exact-head required CI and reviews are inspected with local/CI parity reported honestly.
- [ ] No merge, force-push, addon artifact, tag, release, install, live action, deployment, or settings mutation occurs.

## Evidence

- path: .vibe/EVIDENCE.md
- 38.1–38.4 toolchain, profiles, Vibe roles/hot context, and security policy are reviewed.
- 38.5 exact `7633a4c` passed Full `16/16` in 253.631 seconds, workflow policy, actionlint, zizmor, and release-workflow parity.
- Fast currently passes `13/13`; Security passes 10 checks with LuaLS/Luacheck/StyLua explicitly advisory-unavailable.
- Existing release-policy workflow SHA-256 remains `e625c6232917092f16b9acd421e5641bb3a9527ef5a9402be50bc90e1e203b93`.

## Work log

- Checkpoint 38.6 formal local review passed at exact `34d84fa`: Full `16/16`, Security 10 pass / 3 advisory-unavailable, Package `8/8`, release policy, pre-commit, and base-range diff checks passed.
- A disposable clean worktree at exact `34d84fa` completed tracked bootstrap through `npm ci`, checksum-verified security bootstrap, Lua 5.1 parse `272/272`, integration, and Fast `5/5`; the disposable worktree was removed afterward.
- No checkpoint-hygiene signal or adversarial scope escape was identified. Publication and exact-head CI remain the explicit external boundary after Vibe hygiene.
- Completed bounded 38.6 hygiene: the scope/review receipts contain no stale marker, temporary path, duplicate workflow state, or directly attributable debt; Full was not repeated because no product or test byte changed.
- Dispatcher-selected design split the remaining external publication boundary into checkpoint 38.7 so the exhausted plan does not hide unfinished GitHub coordination.

## Workflow state

- [ ] RUN_STOPPED
- [ ] RUN_CONTEXT_CAPTURE
- [x] STAGE_DESIGNED
- [x] MAINTENANCE_CYCLE_DONE
- [x] RETROSPECTIVE_DONE
- [x] PROCESS_IMPROVEMENTS_DONE

## Active issues

- None.

## Blockers

- None.

## Deferred work

- LuaLS, Luacheck, and StyLua remain advisory-unavailable and are not represented as passes.
- Native test.17 and all install/live/release activity remain outside this infrastructure stage.

## Decisions

- Publish only a draft infrastructure PR against the current PR #10 branch after exact-head validation.
- Keep VibeRun authoritative and retain compact summaries rather than successful log dumps.
- Stop at exact-head CI/review boundary without merge.

## Last completed loop

- Checkpoint 38.6 local adversarial review and hygiene passed; 38.7 is the sole remaining external publication boundary.

## Recommended next action

- Execute final exact-head validation, publish the dedicated branch and draft PR without force, update issue #12, and inspect exact-head CI.
